# Bookshelf

API For bookshelf app

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
MongoDB database
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

Read DB-Prerequistes.txt for DB/Collection/Documents copy-paste action

- 	Visual Studio
		.NET Core SDK 2.2
		MongoDB Driver - Communication from/to MongoDB
			https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver/
```

## Tools used for testing

```
To test the API using HTTP-Requests - https://www.getpostman.com/
```

## External Code Used In Code

I followed this guide
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio
As I haven't made much API's and never used MongoDB - a lot might be used from this.

## My Assumptions and Thoughts

The project is based on .NET Core as that's what we talked about.
I chose to work with MongoDB to get some new knowledge as I have never used it before.

I have also taken my time in Swagger to get to know it which did also take some time (time consumption can be seen on the Branch "Swagger"),
as I do think documentation is quite important.


I have at my best possible kept the time within 4 hours, the project is started at the time of init on github,
I did have some startup issues due to some push issues and some projects being setup wrongly - still within ~4 hours


## SWAGGER!
In the folder called swagger I've placed the HTML2 Export as well as the JSON file, which can easily be used with SwaggerUI

I've setup a SwaggerUI which uses the exact same JSON file - as I personally think SwaggerUI is more read friendly
